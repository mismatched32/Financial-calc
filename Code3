Create a function to print the time required for money to double, given the rate. Use the continuous growth formula from an earlier step.

import math

def time_to_double(principal, annual_interest_rate):
    if annual_interest_rate <= 0:
        return "Invalid interest rate. It should be greater than 0."

    doubling_time = math.log(2) / (annual_interest_rate / 100)
    time_years = doubling_time
    return time_years

def main():
    principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
    annual_interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in percentage): "))

    time_years = time_to_double(principal, annual_interest_rate)

    if isinstance(time_years, str):
        print(time_years)
    else:
        print("Time required for money to double: {:.2f} years".format(time_years))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
